    <h4>These Cheesy Baked Potatoes are always a hit during family gatherings. They are the first to disappear from the table! With a delicious combination of cheese and bacon, the carbs are totally worth it!</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 pieces large Idaho baking potatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>4 oz bacon bits</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>2 tbsp finely shopped chives</li>
        <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter melted at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups grated cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400° F.</li> 
        <li>Take out your baking pan and wrap it with parchment paper.</li> 
        <li>Wash the potatoes well to get rid of the dirt. Place them on a stainless steel wire rack to dry.</li> 
        <li>Get some olive oil, salt and pepper and rub them on the potatoes.</li> 
        <li>Arrange the seasoned potatoes on the baking sheet and bake for about an hour or until fork- tender. Once cooked, set aside to cool.</li> 
        <li>Prepare the crispy bacon. You can either fry them or cook them in the oven like I do! Oven-cooked bacon is healthier and crispier than fried ones. If you chose to fry the bacon, drain them on paper towels and let them cool.</li> 
        <li>When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel one of them completely and place in a mixing bowl.</li> 
        <li>Cut the other potatoes in half, lengthwise. Scoop out about 2 tablespoons to make a bowl and add them to the mixing bowl, make sure to leave out about ¼ inch pulp. Arrange the potato skins back on the baking rack.</li> 
        <li>Mash the potato pulp until smooth and free from clumps. Add the butter, sour cream, 1 cup cheese, bacon bits, half of the chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well then spoon them back into the potato shells.</li> 
        <li>Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and chives and bake for about 15 minutes or until the cheese melts.</li> 
    </ol>
