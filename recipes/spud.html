            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>5 large Idaho baking potatoes</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 3/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp freshly ground white pepper</li>
                <li>4 oz bacon bits</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>2 tbsp finely chopped chives</li>
                <li>4 tbsp unsalted butter, melted at room temperature</li>
                <li>2 cups grated cheddar cheese</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 400°F.</li>
                <li>Take out your baking pan and wrap it with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Wash the potatoes well to get rid of the dirt. Place them on a stainless steel wire rack to dry.</li>
                <li>Get some olive oil, salt, and pepper, and rub them on the potatoes.</li>
                <li>Arrange the seasoned potatoes on the baking sheet and bake for about an hour or until fork-tender. Once cooked, set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>Prepare the crispy bacon. You can either fry them or cook them in the oven. Oven-cooked bacon is healthier and crispier. If frying, drain on paper towels and let cool.</li>
                <li>When the potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel one completely and place it in a mixing bowl.</li>
                <li>Cut the other potatoes in half lengthwise. Scoop out about 2 tablespoons to make a bowl and add them to the mixing bowl, leaving about ¼ inch of pulp. Arrange the potato skins back on the baking rack.</li>
                <li>Mash the potato pulp until smooth. Add the butter, sour cream, 1 cup cheese, bacon bits, half of the chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well and spoon back into the potato shells.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle with the remaining cheese and chives, and bake for about 15 minutes or until the cheese melts.</li>
            </ol>
