# odin-recipes
Upon completion of this project, I will have skills in using HTML to create a website, have knowledge of git commands using the terminal and have better understanding of my IDE which is VS Code. With this project, I will create a recipe website. It will contain my main indexp age and a few links to a few recipes.

This project will only be HTML for now but will be retouched later for adding some style with CSS.
